Smart lightweight design, advanced materials, and optimised manufacturing processes are crucial parameters. Digital solutions for calculation models, production processes, and performance evaluation are essential tools for driving innovation in lightweighting. Lightweighting technology provides environmentally friendly solutions while simultaneously adding commercial value across multiple industries.\nEffects targeted by lightweighting technologies include:\n\nOptimisation of resource and energy efficiency\nSmart lightweight design helps to reduce material and energy consumption during the manufacturing and use phase of new materials and products. Increasing the duration of use and lifespan of lightweight materials and products by wear reduction, slowing down the aging process, and improving material fatigue contributes to resource and energy efficiency. Structural health monitoring of existing and new components indicates when repair or replacement is necessary, further contributing to resource efficiency. The use of simulations, virtual models (digital twin), intelligent process control (machine learning), and automation allows predictive manufacturing, reductions in time-to-market, processing times, and material waste from substandard products, significantly reducing environmental impact and CO2 emissions.\nMaximising efficiency and performance\nLightweighting enables not only weight reduction, but also optimised material use and structural principles for maximum efficiency and performance. The challenge is to develop and implement advanced lightweighting technologies that enable load-optimised material usage while maintaining or improving functionality. This requires integrating digital solutions such as simulations, virtual models (digital twins), and intelligent process control to enhance flexibility and adaptability in lightweight design. Modern manufacturing methods, including additive manufacturing, open new possibilities for application-specific production. To fully unlock the potential of lightweighting, innovative approaches in material selection, shaping, and production must be explored to create economic value.\nBolstering lightweight advancements in mobility and integration in more areas\nThe mobility sector remains a core focus for lightweighting advancements due to its high potential for efficiency gains and environmental impact reduction. Further improvements in lightweight materials, structures, and manufacturing techniques are essential for achieving enhanced fuel efficiency and sustainability in automotive, aerospace, railway, and maritime applications. At the same time, expanding lightweight solutions beyond mobility to other sectors can unlock additional benefits. Standardisation of new lightweight materials, technologies, measuring and testing methods, the development of digital twins, interconnected production processes, and accessible databases on lightweight materials encourage the transfer and development of new lightweight technologies across industries.\n\nRelevant industry sectors include (but are not limited to):\nRegardless of national priorities, all sectors with a need for lightweighting technologies are welcome, including but not limited to automotive, railway, aerospace, space, maritime, mechanical engineering, energy, construction, infrastructure, health, farming, and forestry, etc.\nCall-relevant lightweighting technologies to be researched and developed include (but are not limited to):\nOptimisation of lightweight design approaches\n\nTopology optimisation considering load paths and lightweight design\nAdvanced simulation approaches\nHybrid lightweight construction\nFunctional integration\nSmart/intelligent components\nCondition monitoring\n\nNovel lightweight materials including optimised manufacturing\n\nAdvanced material research for enhanced lightweight performance\nHard coatings and technologies enabling a lifetime expansion\nProcess automation\nSimulations and virtual models (digital twin)\nIntelligent process control (machine learning)\nStandardisation of new lightweight materials and technologies\nStandardisation of measuring and testing methods\nDevelopment of accessible databases on lightweight materials\n\nRecycling of lightweight materials\n\nIncreasing the use of secondary materials\nTechnologies for disjoining\nTechnologies for traceability of chemical compositions\n\nJoining technology\n\nSmart adhesives\nPre-treatment of surfaces\nNew joining technologies\nDevelopment of new welding consumables and solders for special metal mixing combinations\nDevelopment of joining processes for high-strength and low-ductile lightweight materials or mixed connections made of metal-plastic fiber composites\n\nAdditive manufacturing\n\nMulti-material solutions optimised for lightweight applications\nDevelopment of in-situ quality measurement methods\nOptimisation of build-job planning for high productivity\nManufacturing of thin structures\nReducing required support structures for overhangs\nManufacturing of structural parts\nOptimising processes for manufacturing large components\nDevelopment of standardised processing language for different additive manufacturing machines\nQuality assurance through sensing, data acquisition, processing, and machine learning\n\nDigitalisation\n\nSimulations and virtual models for lightweight products/technologies (digital twin)\nIntelligent process control (machine learning)\nDevelopment of standardised processing language for different manufacturing machines\nCoordination with European activities regarding Industry 4.0 (Gaia-X, Catena-X, etc.)\nStructural Health Monitoring of existing and new components\n\nBasic project requirements\nYour project should:\n\noffer relevant contributions to the above-mentioned scope of the call,\naddress at least one of the fields mentioned in the call description and\nfocus on experimental development (TRL 4-6) thus demonstrating the potential to research or develop a product, process or service for commercialisation.\n\nFor further requirements, please check the section on “Eligibility”.\n", "timeframe": "2 April 2025: Announcement of the call\n15 May 2025: Call for projects opens\n23 October 2025: Call for projects deadline\nDecember 2025 to March 2026: Eureka label and funding decisions\nFebruary to June 2026: Projects can start\n", "funding_details": null},
